# PID List

OBD-II PIDs (Parameter IDs) are standardized codes used to request data from a vehicle‚Äôs electronic control units (ECUs) via the On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port. They‚Äôre used by diagnostic tools, scan gauges, and systems like Home Assistant (via CAN integration) to read real-time sensor data.

_Almost_ all PID data is provided in metric.  The expressions below maintain metric measurements of all PIDs.  They may be converted to your unit of preference in your application.  In the case of home assistant, I convert these units to US Imperial in the MQTT YAML configuration.

### Modes

There's two "Modes" of interest:

- **Mode 1** shows "standard" PIDs as specified by SAE.  This includes common things like speed, RPM etc.

- **Mode 22** shows manufacture specific data.  This is where we can get some detailed information about the vehicle.  Manufactures usually standardize around set of code across vehicles.  This means we can take things found on the F-150 or Explorer and apply it to the Transit given simialries in powertrain and modules.

### CAN Bus

The Ford Transit (especially 2020 and newer models) typically includes three main CAN buses, each serving different types of modules based on speed and priority. These buses are part of the vehicle‚Äôs network architecture that allows electronic modules to communicate.

## Modules

| Bus       | Abbreviation | CAN ID (Hex) | Module Name                  |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| HS-CAN1   | PCM          | 0x7E0          | Powertrain Control Module    |
| HS-CAN1   | AWDM         | 0x703          | All-Wheel Drive Module       |
| HS-CAN1   | BCM          | 0x726          | Body Control Module          |

Each module will be broken out by the following:
- PID = Hex Value of Parameter ID
- Name = Short name
- Description = Human understand description
- Units = metric unit for PID
- Expression = Translate value to decimal form
- Status = Status as it relates to WiCAN in this project.

#### Wastegate Solenoid
Indicates duty cycle % sent to wastegate to **OPEN** and release excess boost pressure.

#### Oil Life %
0-100%, same as shown on the instrument panel.

#### Alternator Duty Cycle
Represents the PCM‚Äôs PWM‚Äêduty command to the alternator‚Äôs internal regulator, not a direct measure of alternator load. The PCM continuously reads system voltage (via its voltage PIDs) and, when voltage sags under electrical demand (lights, HVAC, winch, etc.), ramps up the duty cycle to boost field current and raise alternator output; when voltage is high and load light, it dials the duty back down to prevent overcharging.

Low percentages (10‚Äì30 %) at cruising indicate minimal charge maintenance, while high percentages (50‚Äì100 %) under heavy electrical load or low RPM signal the PCM driving the alternator hard. Because GENCMD is a control signal rather than a sensor of current or torque, you‚Äôll want to pair it with the Mode 22 Battery Current PID (0x2142) and system‚Äêvoltage PIDs to see the actual amps flowing and get a true picture of charging‚Äêsystem load.

#### Learned Octane Ratio 
The Learned Octane Ratio (LOR) is a closed-loop **multiplier** the PCM uses to dynamically adjust its load and spark-advance tables based on fuel knock feedback. As the engine runs, the PCM incrementally ‚Äúlearns‚Äù the octane quality by nudging spark timing forward (seeking maximum efficiency) and watching for knock. If no knock occurs, it continues advancing toward its high-octane target; if knock is detected, it retreats toward a conservative, lower-octane calibration. This system lets the EcoBoost engine safely exploit whatever octane you‚Äôve filled it with, optimizing power and efficiency without manual tuning.

Learned Octane Ratio is a relative tuning factor, not an absolute octane meter. Ford calibrates LOR so that zero corresponds to the engine‚Äôs nominal (recommended) fuel rating.  For the Transit, that's 87 AKI. When you run on 87-octane, LOR will hover around 0.0, meaning the PCM is using its baseline spark‚Äêadvance tables.

- LOR ‚âà 0.0 ‚Üí you‚Äôre at the recommended 87 AKI
- LOR < 0.0 ‚Üí fuel is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù (higher octane) than 87 ‚Üí PCM advances spark
- LOR > 0.0 ‚Üí fuel is ‚Äúweaker‚Äù (lower octane) than 87 ‚Üí PCM retards spark

#### Fuel pump duty cycle 
The PCM‚Äôs PWM command to the low-pressure (lift) fuel pump in the tank. Rather than simply switching the pump fully on or off, the PCM modulates the pump‚Äôs duty between 0‚Äì100 % to precisely control the flow and maintain the target feed pressure for the high-pressure direct-injection system. This can be useful for how how hard the fuel pump is working drawing fuel from the tank.

#### Fuel Rate  
#### Fuel System Status
**Open Loop** - Fuel Ratio determined based on static table.  Used on cold start and wide-open throttle situations
**Closed Loop** - Fuel ratio is determined using measurements from narrowband oxygen sensors to maintain stochmetic fuel ratio of 14.67:1

#### Fuel Pressure Desired
PCM Desired fuel pressure based on calculated engine load.

#### Fuel Pressure Sensor
Actual fuel pressure measured.  Difference between pressure sensor and desired pressure determines pump duty cycle.

### All-Wheel Drive Module (AWDM)

On the 2021 Transit AWD has a RWD-biased system that can divert up to 50% of the torque to the front wheels by activating a electronic-hydraulic clutch pack.  This is called a Front Axle Disconnect (FAD) system.  

In its mechanically default position, the front drive shaft is disconnected.  When the AWDM activates the electronic-hydraulic clutch pack, it connects the front drive shaft.  Up to 50% of engine torque can be diverted to the front wheels if the clutch is fully engaged.

While in technical terrain, it may be useful to display the torque split between front/rear wheels. I've consolidated the available sensors to the following relevant sensors:

#### Front-Axle Disconnect Actuator Status  
Shows the real-time state of the Front-Axle Disconnect actuator.  
- **1 = ‚ÄúFAD in 4WD ‚Äì CONNECTED‚Äù** means the front driveshaft is actively engaged, supplying torque to the front & rear wheels.  
- **0 = ‚ÄúFAD in 2WD ‚Äì DISCONNECTED‚Äù** would indicate the front axle is released and supplying torque to only rear-wheel drive only.

> All states above have yet to be confirmed.

#### Front-Axle Disconnect Strategy Command  
The high-level strategy request from the PCM governing AWD mode.  
- **01 = Connect Request** signals ‚Äúgo AWD‚Äù‚Äîthe system wants front-axle engagement.  
- **00 = Disconnect Request** signals ‚Äúback to RWD‚Äù‚Äîthe system wants the front axle released.  
- **Modulate** (if supported) requests smooth, partial engagement to meter torque split.

> All states above have yet to be confirmed.

#### Front Axle Disconnect Input Duty Cycle  
The PWM duty-cycle (0‚Äì100 %) applied to the disconnect control valve.  
- **0 %** means no disengage signal (clutch remains engaged).
- Higher values ramp open the clutch pack proportionally, allowing controlled slip or full disconnect.
- **100 %** means full disengage signal (clutch disengaged) 

> Engage/disengage spectrum yet to be confirmed

#### Torque Converter Clutch Duty-Cycle  
The PWM duty-cycle (0‚Äì100 %) applied to the torque-converter clutch solenoid to control lock-up pressure.  
- **Low duty-cycle** = minimal lock-up (more fluid coupling >> more slip, more heat, ).  
- **High duty-cycle** = stronger lock-up (more mechanical coupling >> more efficiency, less heat).
